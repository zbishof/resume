% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% TODO:
% 1. Add various styling and section options and allow for multiple pages smoothly.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.3:
% 1. Removed MacFonts version as I have no desire to maintain it nor access to macOS
% 2. Switched column ordering
% 3. Changed font styles/colors for easier human readability
% 4. Added, removed, and rearranged sections to reflect my own experience
% 5. Hid last updated
%
% v1.2:
% 1. Added publications in place of societies.
% 2. Collapsed a portion of education.
% 3. Fixed a bug with alignment of overflowing long last updated dates on the top right.
%
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
